About:
This was my second and fourth project in The Odin Project's coursework. The first project assignment was to create a basic rock paper scissors game to be played in the browser console. I later added a GUI with buttons and text for the next assignment.

Objectives:
-learn how to structure a JavaScript file and how to include in a page
-build my first JavaScript program from scratch
-practicing planning out and pseudocoding my solution before writing code
-testing each piece of code and function to ensure functioning before moving on
-write functions for different pieces of the game logic
-applying clean code best practices (camelCase, clear variable and function names, etc.)
-practice loops in JavaScript
-practice DOM manipulation (targeting nodes with selectors, finding/adding/removing/altering nodes, inline styling, editing attributes/classes, adding text content)
-implement event listeners with JavaScript
